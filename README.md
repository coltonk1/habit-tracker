# Habit Tracker

This is a simple habit tracker app to help you keep track of your habits and how often you complete them. It includes a built-in database where your data is stored (with a basic XOR encryption for some added privacy). You can add new habits, mark them as completed, see your progress, and remove habits you no longer want to track. It's a fun and easy way to stay on top of your goals while keeping your data organized.

## How to run

1. Have Python 3.x installed
2. Clone this repo
3. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder
4. Run 'py main.py'

## Note

This app is intended for personal use and was created for my own learning purposes. The encryption used here (XOR) is not secure for sensitive data.
